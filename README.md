# Sprint-7-project
*Project Overview

This project is a Streamlit-based web application that visualizes fast food nutrition data. The app was  deployed using Render for cloud hosting. The project is mainly focused on the app functionality, rather than the data analysis. Therefore, the dataset was not analyzed in depth. Basically, this app is meant to build a scatter plot and a histogram that shows nutrition data on different restaurants & items when the user clicks on the button and ticks the box. 


*Features

-Interactive Visualizations: Use Plotly for dynamic graphs.
-Virtual Environment: Anaconda (fastfood_env)
-Deployment: Render

*Setup & Deployment

-Clone the repository.
